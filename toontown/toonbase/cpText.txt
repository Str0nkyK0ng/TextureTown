They're known for their awesome team work. Few realize that each week blue puffles eat their weight in cookies.
From the wilds of Rockhopper Island, they love adventure. Puffle experts wonder what secrets they hold.
It is said that the pink puffle's fur can hold 30 times its weight in water.
The flash of a disco ball transforms this stylish puffle into a powerful dance force.
Although mostly quiet, sudden fiery outbursts show there is more to these intense creatures than meets the eye.
Are experts on unicycles. They are
also known for their love of
April Fool's parties.
It may be smaller than all other puffles, but its power is unmeasurable
It is rumored that the yellow puffle creates artwork from food and furniture.
This species has teeth strong enough to demolish petrified Puffle O's. And everything else.
It is documented that the brown puffle blinks more than all other puffles. Its dreams have graph paper backgrounds.

Welcome to the Waddle On party, everyone. It�s our celebration of the years of fun we�ve had on the island.
Test your knowledge with trivia questions and fill out your memories page. And thank you for making the Club Penguin community so amazing!
It�s time for puffle questions in the Forest. I�ve written a couple that might even stump PH herself!
Looks like you enjoy the fuzzy furballs as much as I do! Well done.
There are new trivia questions. But they�re in a secret location!
I suppose I should be concerned about EPF knowledge going public, but I�m impressed!
If you�re a history buff, then check out the Cove for new trivia questions.
Good job with the trivia. You could be a Club Penguin Times reporter.
Visit the Dock and test your knowledge about items and igloos.
Excellent job. You sound like an avid collector of items.
Are you a black belt? Then you�ll score high on the Ninja trivia in the Dojo.
What does Sensei say? Something about �rocking the house�? I�m sure that applies to you here.
The Stadium is hosting the next big trivia match!
GOAL! What a performance! I enjoyed that as much as any soccer match
The island has transformed a lot over the years. Test your memory of rooms in the Plaza.
You�ve paid close attention to the island over the years. Well done.
Together, we can build an island, create a community, change the world... and even tip an iceberg. Waddle on.
You've proven to be a trivia master and collected every pin for your memory book. Well done!
Amazing! I never thought I�d witness the iceberg tipping! Congratulations on your discovery.
